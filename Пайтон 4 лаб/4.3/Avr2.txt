In the literature of medieval Byzantium, the pagan Marcus Aurelius appears
a sage known in many sciences and full of virtues
a righteous man who lacks little to convert to the true faith,
and even to holiness: miracles are attributed to him
(The emperor allegedly caused rain when his army was exhausted
from lack of water), and death, almost martyrdom
 (According to the chronicle of George Amartol, he was poisoned by insidious
 enemies); note that this image is wise and merciful
ruler, almost a Christian, and adopted the ancient n tradition.
